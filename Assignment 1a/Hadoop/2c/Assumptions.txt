Assumptions considered for matrix multiplication:  
i)   Matrix and vector are stored in two seperate files
ii)  Each entry in matrix is represented as (row,column,entry)
iii) Each entry in vector is represented as (row,entry)
iv)  For the given input files, I've considered no of splits as 3 (hardcoded)
