Intuitively, with an increase in the number of mappers and reducers the time should decrease because the parallelization increases. But, for word count the performance seems to degrade with increase in mappers and reducers (for certain cases). This might be due to the fact that the parallelization is done on a relatively small dataset or also because the data is being moved around unnecessarily which increases the process time.
